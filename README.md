*Submitted by:* Olga Rozhdestvina (Student No: G00387844) 

*Lecturer:* Dominic Carr

*Programming Languages used:* [Python](https://www.python.org/)

<br>

The sorting algorithms are chosen according to the following criteria:

1. A simple comparison-based sort (Insertion Sort)
2. An efficient comparison-based sort (Quicksort and Heap Sort)
3. A non-comparison sort (Radix Sort and Counting Sort)
4. A hybrid sort (IntroSort)

An introduction to the above algorithms as well as an analysis of their implementation and benchmarking are concluded in a report.
